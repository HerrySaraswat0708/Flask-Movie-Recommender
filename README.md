# Movies Recommendation System

This repository contains a collaborative filtering-based movies recommendation system. The system utilizes the TMDB 5000 movies dataset to create movie vectors using text vectorization techniques. It then calculates cosine similarity between movie vectors to generate recommendations.

## Overview

The movies recommendation system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and the similarity between movies. Collaborative filtering is employed to analyze the behavior of multiple users and make recommendations based on similarities in their movie preferences.

## Dataset

The TMDB 5000 movies dataset is used as the primary data source. This dataset contains information about movies, including their titles, genres, keywords, and user ratings. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features for movie vectorization.

## Text Vectorization

Text vectorization is performed to convert movie information into a vector representation. In this system, each movie is represented as a vector of dimension 5000, with each dimension corresponding to a unique term or keyword in the dataset. The vectorization process captures the textual characteristics of each movie and enables comparison and similarity calculations.

## Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity is employed to measure the distance or similarity between movie vectors. The movie vectors form a matrix of dimensions 5000x5000, where each element represents the cosine similarity between two movies. The higher the cosine similarity value, the more similar the movies are considered to be.

By utilizing cosine similarity, the system can identify movies that have similar characteristics or are likely to appeal to the same set of users. This approach allows for personalized recommendations based on user preferences and movie similarities.

## Usage

To use the movies recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movies-recommendation-system.git

2. Download the TMDB 5000 movies dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.

3. Install the required dependencies. You can specify the dependencies and their versions in a `requirements.txt` file or provide installation instructions specific to your system.

4. Preprocess the dataset and perform text vectorization to generate movie vectors.

5. Calculate the cosine similarity matrix based on the movie vectors.

6. Implement the recommendation algorithm using collaborative filtering. This algorithm can take user preferences, movie similarity matrix, and other factors into account to generate personalized movie recommendations.

7. Provide a user interface or API that allows users to input their preferences and receive movie recommendations based on the collaborative filtering algorithm.

## Examples

To help you get started, we have provided some example code in the `examples` directory. These examples demonstrate how to preprocess the dataset, perform text vectorization, calculate cosine similarity, and generate movie recommendations based on collaborative filtering.

Feel free to modify and adapt the examples to suit your specific needs and requirements. You can also explore different approaches to enhance the recommendation algorithm or incorporate additional features such as user feedback or demographic information.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the movies recommendation system, consider using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or mean average precision. These metrics assess the quality and relevance of the recommended movies compared to user preferences or ground truth data.

Additionally, you can perform user studies or collect feedback to understand the satisfaction level of users with the recommended movies. Incorporating user feedback can help improve the system's recommendations over time.
